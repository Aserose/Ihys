# Ihys

**Ihys** is a music aggregator with which you can conveniently and quickly collect similar tracks from all music services in one place - Telegram. If you authorize VK, it will not only give access to the music service, but also the ability to get similar tracks on entire playlists.

The result is a list of similar songs in an inline keyboard with easy-to-follow browsing controls. If you select one of them, the song menu will open with a YouTube video link, and you can also search for similar songs already on this one and get a popular one from the same artist. The previous menus will remain open, meaning that you can search for similar songs on several songs at the same time.

Although the basic features have already been implemented, there are plans to refine them significantly and the possibility of adding new ones is also being considered. This will happen very soon, after which the bot will be deployed and available to all.
